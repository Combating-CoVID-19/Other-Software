# Covid-19-Challenge
Our repo for the Covid-19 challenge set up by the NYAS.

The Challenge
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider the obstacles faced by governments, healthcare providers and/or patients and design a technology-based solution that can be deployed in response to combat COVID-19. The solution can be an improvement of an already existing technology or a new application.  Solutions should consider the following: 

Modes and rates of disease transmission 

Known preventative and protective measures against COVID-19

Lack of vaccine, medication, and treatment for COVID-19

The public health system, local healthcare infrastructure, access to technology and other relevant contexts
